Fz2jacop -- FlatZinc for JaCoP
==============================

FlatZinc is a low-level solver input language that is the target
language for MiniZinc. It is designed to be easy to translate into the
form required by a CP solver. JaCoP package JaCoP.fz contains a
compiler, constraint and search generation as well as invokes JaCoP
solver to solve a compiled FlatZinc model. More information on
MiniZinc and FlatZinc as well as related software can be found on
http://www.g12.cs.mu.oz.au/minizinc/.

Installation
============

The package is a part of JaCoP distribution. It can be compiled with
javacc and java compiler. The specific JaCoP predicate definitions for
MiniZinc are available in org/jacop/minizinc/mznlib. They can be used in mzn2fzn
compilation with either -I or -G options, as described later. Please,
note that if this library is not used mzn2fzn will use only simple
constraints for all predicates. For example, MiniZinc all_different
constraint will use inequality constraints instead of using JaCoP
Alldiff or Alldistinct constraints.

Executing MiniZinc models
=========================

MiniZinc models needs to be first compiled into FlatZinc. It is
achieved with mzn2fzn compiler available in MiniZinc distribution
(http://www.g12.cs.mu.oz.au/minizinc/). The command usually looks as
follows.

$ mzn2fzn -I <path_to_mznlib> <file>.mzn

path_to_mznlib is the **complete path** to the mznlib directory. "."
and ".." are not interpreted correctly.

The command can be also given as 

$ mzn2fzn -G jacop <file>.mzn

if the directory mznlib will be copied to lib/minizinc directory of
the MiniZinc installation and renamed to jacop.

mzn2fzn accepts other options. Please, run mzn2fzn -h for more
details. A useful option is "--no-output-pred-decls" since Fz2jacop
does not process predicates anyway.

Once the FlatZinc file has been generated the execution in JaCoP can
be achieved by issuing the following command.

$ java -cp <class_path_to_JaCoP>:<class_path_to_jdom.jar> JaCoP.fz.Fz2jacop <file>.fzn

This command will compile FlatZinc model and execute it using JaCoP solver.

NOTE 1: Large models might require to increase memory available for
        JVM. This is achieved by giving java option. For example,
        -Xmx1G extends heap memory to 1GB and -Xmx700M to 700MB.

NOTE 2: All definitions of integer variables ("var int:" and "array[...]
        of var int:" are translated to JaCoP finite domain variable with
        min/max intervals, i.e., -10000000..10000000. It may create
        that the model will report overflow/underflow or it will be
        unsatisfiable. The problem might still be solvable if finite
        domain variables will be defined with explicit intervals
        instead (with lower bounds).

Execution of Fz2jacop compiler gives the set of actually accepted
options, as shown below.

Usage: java Fz2jacop [<options>] <file>.fzn
Options:
    -h, --help
        Print this message.
    -a, --all-solutions
    -v, --verbose
    -t <value>, --time-out <value>
        <value> - time in second.
    -s, --statistics
    -n <value>, --num-solutions <value>
        <value> - limit on solution number.
