/**
 * This class provides mutable variable functionality. The variable value
 * depends on the store level. Each value is time stamped with different store
 * level. This class lets you avoid recomputation every time a solver
 * backtracks. It will simply use the value with older time stamp. It is
 * appropriate for objects which do not share data across store levels. If you
 * have objects which share data across store levels than you need to make your
 * own implementation of mutable variable using MutableVar interface.
 *
 * It will (it has to) store the same object at different levels as users of the
 * timestamp may ask for the level at which the timestamp was recently updated.
