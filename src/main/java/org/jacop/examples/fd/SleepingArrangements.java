/**
 *
 * It is a simple logic puzzle about sleeping arrangements.
 *
 * @author Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * The Dillies have five teenaged children, two boys named Ollie and
 * Rollie, and three girls named Mellie, Nellie, and Pollie. Each is a
 * different number of years old, from 13 to 17. There are three bedrooms
 * for the children in the Dillie house, so two share the yellow room,
 * two share the white room, and one alone has the smaller green
 * room. Can you match each one's name and age, and tell who sleeps
 * where?
 *
 * 1. No one shares a room with a sibling of the opposite sex.
 *
 * 2. Pollie is exactly one year older than Mellie.
 *
 * 3. The two teenagers who share the yellow room are two years apart in age.
 *
 * 4. The two who share the white room are three years apart in age.
 *
 * 5. Rollie is somewhat older than Ollie, but somewhat younger than the
 * sibling who has the green room.
 *
 * Determine: Child -- Age -- Room
 *
 * Given solution :
 *
 * Mellie, 16, green room
 * Nellie, 14, white room
 * Ollie, 13, yellow room
 * Pollie, 17, white room
 * Rollie, 15, yellow room
