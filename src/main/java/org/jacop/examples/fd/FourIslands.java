/**
 *
 * It is a very simple puzzle about islands and bridges.
 *
 * @author Waldemar Sliwinski, Zdzislaw Zawada, and Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * A tiny nation in the South Pacific contains four islands connected by
 * bridges as shown (see below). Each of the four islands (Pwana, Quero,
 * Rayou, and Skern) boasts a different primary export (alabaster,
 * bananas, coconuts, and durian fruit) and a different tourist
 * attraction (hotel, ice skating rink, jai alai stadium, and koala
 * preserve). Can you find the name, export, and tourist attraction of
 * each island on the map?
 *
 *    N
 *  W   E     *compass directions
 *    S
 *
 * A, B, C, D are the islands
 *
 * (A) -- (B)
 *  |      |
 *  |      |
 * (C) -- (D)
 *
 * (view with non-proportional font)
 * 1. The island noted for its koala preserve is due south of Pwana.
 *
 * 2. The island with the largest alabaster quarry is due west of Quero.
 *
 * 3. The island with the resort hotel is due east of the one that exports durian fruit.
 *
 * 4. Skern and the island with the jai alai stadium are connected by a north-south bridge.
 *
 * 5. Rayou and the island that exports bananas are connected by an east-west bridge.
 *
 * 6. The islands noted for the South Pacific's largest ice skating rink and for the jai alai stadium are not connected by a bridge.
 *
 * Determine: Island location -- Island name -- Export -- Tourist Attraction
 *
 * ANSWER:
 * Northwest, Pwana, durian fruit, ice skating rink
 * Northeast, Skern, coconuts, hotel
 * Southwest, Rayou, alabaster, koala preserve
 * Southeast, Quero, bananas, jai alai stadium
