 * Stars: 2
 * At the last meeting of the local city council, each member
 * (Mr. Akerman, Ms. Baird, Mr. Chatham, Ms. Duval, and Mr. Etting)
 * had to vote on five motions, number 1 to 5 in the clues below.
 * Can you discover how each one voted on each motion?
 *
 *
 * Note: a motion may have received zero or one yes vote, even though
 * in real life it's unlikely that both the maker and seconder of
 * the motion would change their minds before the motion came up for a vote.
 * Each member voted either yes or no on each motion; no one abstained
 * from voting on any motion.
 *
 * Voting Chart
 * (view with non-proportional fonts)
 *
 *               1     2     3     4     5
 * Mr. Akerman
 * Ms. Baird
 * Mr. Chatham
 * Ms. Duval
 * Mr. Etting

 * 1. Each motion got a different number of yes votes.
 * 2. In all, the five motions got three more yes votes than no votes.
 * 3. No two council members voted the same way on all five motions.
 * 4. The two women disagreed in their voting more often than they agreed.
 * 5. Mr. Chatham never made two yes votes on consecutive motions.
 * 6. Mr. Akerman and Ms. Baird both voted in favor of motion 4.
 * 7. Motion 1 received two more yes votes than motion 2 did.
 * 8. Motion 3 received twice as many yes votes as motion 4 did.
 *
 * Determine: fill in the chart (Yes/No) for each motion
