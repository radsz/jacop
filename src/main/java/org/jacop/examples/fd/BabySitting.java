/**
 *
 * It is a simple logic puzzle about babysitting.
 *
 * @author Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * Each weekday, Bonnie takes care of five of the neighbors'
 * children. The children's names are Keith, Libby, Margo, Nora, and
 * Otto; last names are Fell, Grant, Hall, Ivey, and Jule. Each is a
 * different number of years old, from two to six. Can you find each
 * child's full name and age?

 * 1. One child is named Libby Jule.
 * 2. Keith is one year older than the Ivey child, who is one year older than Nora.
 * 3. The Fell child is three years older than Margo.
 * 4. Otto is twice as many years old as the Hall child.

 * Determine: First name - Last name - Age


 * Given solution :

 * Keith Fell, five years old
 * Libby Jule, six years old
 * Margo Hall, two years old
 * Nora Grant, three years old
 * Otto Ivey, four years old
 *
