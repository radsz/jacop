/**
 *
 * It is a simple logic puzzle about lectures.
 *
 * @author Grzegorz Moskwa, Marcin Nowak, and Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * Last week at school was made varied by a series of lectures, one each
 * day (Monday through Friday), in the auditorium.  None of the lectures
 * was particularly interesting (on choosing a college, physical
 * hygiene, modern art, nutrition, and study habits), but the students
 * figured that anything that got them out of fourth period was
 * okay. The lecturers were two women named Alice and Bernadette, and
 * three men named Charles, Duane, and Eddie; last names were Felicidad,
 * Garber, Haller, Itakura, and Jeffreys.  Can you find each day's
 * lecturer and subject?
 *
 * 1. Alice lectured on Monday.
 *
 * 2. Charles's lecture on physical hygiene wasn't given on Friday.
 *
 * 3. Dietician Jeffreys gave the lecture on nutrition.
 *
 * 4. A man gave the lecture on modern art.
 *
 * 5. Ms. Itakura (*5a) and the lecturer on proper study habits spoke on
 * consecutive days, in one order or the other.(*5b)
 *
 * 6. Haller gave a lecture sometime after Eddie did.
 *
 * 7. Duane Felicidad (*7a) gave his lecture sometime before the modern
 * art lecture(*7b)
 *
 *
 * Answer:
 *
 * Monday, Alice Itakura, choosing a college
 * Tuesday, Duane Felicidad, study habits
 * Wednesday, Eddie Garber, modern art
 * Thursday, Charles Haller, physical hygiene
 * Friday, Bernadette Jeffreys, nutrition
