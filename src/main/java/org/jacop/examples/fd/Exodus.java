/**
 *
 * It is a simple logic puzzle about children reading stories.
 *
 * Title: Exodus
 * Author: Sophy McHannot
 * Publication: Dell Logic
 * Puzzles Issue: April, 1998 Page: 14 Stars: 2

 * In preparation for Passover, five children at Hebrew school
 * (Bernice, Carl, Debby, Sammy, and Ted) have been chosen to
 * present different parts of the story of the Exodus from Egypt
 * (burning bush, captivity, Moses's youth, Passover, or the Ten
 * Commandments).  Each child is a different age (three, five,
 * seven, eight, or ten), and the family of each child has
 * recently made its own exodus to America from a different
 * country (Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Morocco, or
 * Yemen). Can you find the age of each child, his or her
 * family's country of origin, and the part of the Exodus story
 * each related?
 *
 * 1. Debby's family is from Lithuania.
 *
 * 2. The child who told the story of the Passover is two years
 * older than Bernice.
 *
 * 3. The child whose family is from Yemen is younger than the
 * child from the Ethiopian family.
 *
 * 4. The child from the Moroccan family is three years older
 * than Ted.
 *
 * 5. Sammy is three years older than the child who told the
 * story of Moses's youth in the house of the Pharaoh.
 *
 * 6. Carl related the story of the captivity of the Israelites
 * in Egypt.
 *
 * 7. The five-year-old child told the story of the Ten
 * Commandments.
 *
 * 8. The child who told the story of the burning bush is either
 * two or three years older than the one whose family came
 * from Kazakhstan.
 *
 * Determine: Age -- Child -- Country -- Story
