/**
 *
 * It solves a simple logic puzzle - Dollar and Ticket problem.
 *
 * @author Wojciech Swietek, Maciej Trela, and Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 *
 * Every year the Soccer Club has a raffle to support the cost of playing
 * fields, equipment, and camps.  This year the top five sellers were
 * three girls named Diane, Jenny, and Maggie, and two boys named Greg
 * and Kevin; last names are Borecki, Ott, Panos, Ruiz, and Vogel. Each
 * of them is on a different team (the Bobcats, Cheetahs, Kickers,
 * Stars, and Wolves), and each sold a different number of books of
 * tickets (20, 18, 12, 10, and 6).  Can you match each seller's full
 * name with his or her team and number of ticket books sold?
 *
 * 1. Jenny sold exactly twice as many books as Ms. Ruiz.
 * 2. The one who sold 12 books (who isn't Panos) isn't on the Bobcats or Stars.
 * 3. The player from the Wolves sold at least twice as many books as Ott.
 * 4. Borecki isn't on the Kickers.
 * 5. The girl on the Cheetahs sold exactly three times as many books as Diane.
 * 6. Greg isn't Borecki or Ott.
 * 7. Kevin isn't on the Bobcats.
