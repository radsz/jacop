/**
 *
 * A simple logic puzzle about golf players.
 *
 * @author Mariusz Czarnojan, Krystian Burka, and Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * "A Round of Golf"

 * When the Sunny Hills Country Club golf course isn't in use by club members,
 * of course, it's open to the club's employees.
 * Recently, Jack and three other workers at the golf course got together on their day
 * off to play a round of eighteen holes of golf.
 * Afterward, all four, including Mr. Green, went to the clubhouse to total their scorecards.
 * Each man works at a different job (one is a short-order cook), and each shot a different score
 * in the game. No one scored below 70 or above 85 strokes.
 * From the clues below, can you discover each man's full name, job and golf score?
 *
 * 1. Bill, who is not the maintenance man, plays golf often and had the lowest score of the foursome.
 * 2. Mr. Clubb, who isn't Paul, hit several balls into the woods and scored ten strokes
 *    more than the pro-shop clerk.
 * 3. In some order, Frank and the caddy scored four and seven more strokes than Mr. Sands.
 * 4. Mr. Carter thought his score of 78 was one of his better games, even though Frank's score
 *    was lower.
 * 5. None of the four scored exactly 81 strokes.
 *
 * Solution
 * Bill Sands Cook 71
 * Jack Clubb Maint 85
 * Paul Carter Caddy 78
 * Frank Green Clerk 75
