/**
 *
 * A simple logic problem of transporting wolf, goat, and cabbage over the river.
 *
 * @author Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * We need to transfer the cabbage, the goat and the wolf from one bank of the river to
 * the other bank. But there is only one seat available on his boat !
 *
 * Furthermore, if the goat and the cabbage stay together as we are leaving on a boat,
 * the goat will eat the cabbage. And if the wolf and the goat stay together as we are leaving,
 * the wolf will eat the goat !
