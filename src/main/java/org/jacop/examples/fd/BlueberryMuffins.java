 *
 *  Logic Puzzle: Blueberry Muffins
 *
 * Description :
 *
 * Daniel made a dozen blueberry muffins on Friday night -- and by
 * the timehe was ready for brunch on Saturday, there were only
 * two left. The other ten had been snitched by his housemates,
 * all of whom had gotten up early because they had to work on
 * Saturday. The fourhousemates include two men named Bill and
 * Mark, and two women named Calla and Lynn; last names are Ellis,
 * Ingham, Oakley, and Summers, and their differing professions
 * are dogcatcher, flautist, secretary, and zookeeper. Can you
 * discover each one's full name, profession, and number of
 * muffins snitched?

 * 1. Each housemate snitched a different number of muffins from one to four.
 * 2. Bill and Ellis snitched a total of six muffins.
 * 3. The secretary (who is a woman) snitched more than the dogcatcher.
 * 4. Mark snitched two more than Summers did.
 * 5. The flautist snitched twice as many as Ms. Oakley did.
 * 6. Calla's last name isn't Ingham.

 * Solution:

 * Calla Oakley dogcatcher 1 muffin
 * Bill Summers flautist 2 muffins
 * Lynn Ingham secretary 3 muffins
 * Mark Ellis zookeeper 4 muffins
