/**

 *
 * Wan Li, a dealer in Chinese antiques and artifacts, had an excellent
 * month recently when he made sales to four customers from around the
 * world -- Finland, Italy, Japan, and the United States -- who were
 * willing and able to pay very good prices. The four items were rare
 * jade figurines (a belt buckle, dragon, grasshopper, and horse), each
 * carved from a different color of jade (dark green, light green, red,
 * and white). Each piece dates from a different Chinese dynasty (Ching,
 * Ming, Sung, and Tang). Can you match each figurine with its color and
 * dynasty, and give the home country of each buyer?
 *
 *
 * 1. The rare white dragon (which the American didn't buy) didn't come
 * from the Sung dynasty.
 *
 * 2. The exquisite belt buckle (which wasn't any shade of green) was
 * created in 618 A.D. for an emperor of the Tang dynasty.
 *
 * 3. Three of the figurines were the one bought by the Finn (which
 * wasn't the dragon), the one from the Ching dynasty (which didn't go
 * to the buyer from Japan), and the light green object (which wasn't
 * the horse).
 *
 * 4. The American decided against both the grasshopper and the piece
 * from the Sung dynasty, neither of which she felt would match her
 * home decor.
 *
 *
 * Belt buckle, red, Tang, U.S
 * Dragon, white, Ching, Italy
 * Grasshopper, light green, Ming, Japan
 * Horse, dark green, Sung, Finland
