/**
 *
 * It is a simple logic puzzle about houses.
 *
 * @author Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * Each year the Glendale Women's Club sponsors a Historic Homes Tour in which
 * five old houses are (with the owners' permission, of course) opened to the
 * public. This year the five homes are on different streets (Azalea Drive,
 * Crepe Myrtle Court, Jasmine Boulevard, Magnolia Street, and Oleander Road),
 * and each was built in a different year (1860, 1870, 1890, 1900, and 1920).
 * Can you give the order in which the tour visited the five homes (identifying
 * them by street) and match each with its year?
 *
 * 1. The home on Jasmine is 20 years older than the one on Azalea.
 * 2. The third home on the tour was built in 1860.
 * 3. The tour visited the home on Magnolia sometime before the one built in 1890.
 * 4. The tour visited the home on Oleander (which wasn't the last of the five to
 * be built) sometime before it visited the one on Jasmine, which in turn was
 * seen sometime before the one built in 1900.
 *
 * Determine: Order -- Street -- Year
