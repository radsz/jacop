/**
 *
 * It solves a logic puzzle about singing women.
 *
 * @author Zbigniew Danielczyk, Mariusz Jedrzejko, and Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * The great mezzo-soprano Flora Nebbiacorno has retired from the
 * international opera stage, but she still teaches master classes
 * regularly.  At a recent class, her five students were one soprano,
 * one mezzo-soprano, two tenors, and one bass.  (The first two voice
 * types are women's, and the last two are men's).  Their first names
 * are Chris, J.P., Lee, Pat, and Val -- any of which could belong to a
 * man or a woman - - and their last names are Kingsley, Robinson,
 * Robinson (the two are unrelated but have the same last name), Ulrich,
 * and Walker. Can you find the order in which these five sang for the
 * class, identifying each by full name and voice type?
 *
 * 1. The first and second students were, in some order, Pat and the bass.
 *
 * 2. The second and third students included at least one tenor.
 *
 * 3. Kingsley and the fifth student (who isn't named Robinson) were, in
 * some order, a mezzo-soprano and a tenor.
 *
 * 4. Neither the third student, whose name is Robinson, nor Walker has
 * the first name of Chris.
 *
 * 5. Ulrich is not the bass or the mezzo-soprano.
 *
 * 6. Neither Lee or Val (who wasn't third) is a tenor.
 *
 * 7. J.P. wasn't third, and Chris wasn't fifth.
 *
 * 8. The bass isn't named Robinson.
 *
 * Determine: Order -- First name -- Last name -- Voice
