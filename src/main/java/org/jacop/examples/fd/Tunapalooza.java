/**
 *
 * It solves a simple logic puzzle about music concert.
 *
 * @author Lesniak Kamil, Harezlak Roman, Radoslaw Szymanek
 * @version 4.2
 *
 * Tim and Keri have a full day ahead for themselves as they plan to see
 * and hear everything at Tunapalooza '98, the annual save-the-tuna
 * benefit concert in their hometown. To cover the most ground, they
 * will have to split up.  They have arranged to meet during four rock
 * band acts (Ellyfish, Korrupt, Retread Ed and the Flat Tires, and
 * Yellow Reef) at planned rendezvous points (carnival games,
 * information booth, mosh pit, or T-shirt vendor).  Can you help match
 * each band name with the type of music they play (country, grunge,
 * reggae, or speed metal) and Tim and Kerri's prearranged meeting spot
 * while they play?
 *
 * 1. Korrupt isn't a country or grunge music band.
 *
 * 2. Tim and Kerri won't meet at the carnival games during Ellyfish's performance.
 *
 * 3. The pair won't meet at the T-shirt vendor during the reggae band's show.
 *
 * 4. Exactly two of the following three statements are true:
 * a) Ellyfish plays grunge music.
 * b) Tim and Kerri won't meet at the information booth during a performance by Retread Ed and the Flat Tires.
 * c) The two friends won't meet at the T-shirt vendor while Yellow Reef is playing.
 *
 * 5. The country and speed metal acts are, in some order, Retread Ed and the Flat Tires
 * and the act during which Tim and Kerri will meet at the mosh pit.
 *
 * 6. The reggae band is neither Korrupt nor the act during which Tim and
 * Kerri will meet at the information booth.
 *
 * Determine: Band name -- Music type -- Meeting place
 *
 * Given solution :
 *
 * 1 Ellyfish, grunge,  vendor
 * 2 Korrupt,  metal,   mosh
 * 3 Retread,  country, information
 * 4 Yellow ,  reggae,  carnival
