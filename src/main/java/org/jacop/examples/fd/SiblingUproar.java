/**
 *
 * It is quite complex logic puzzle about siblings.
 *
 * @author Krzysztof "Vrbl" Wrobel, Wioletta "Vuka" Kruzolek, and Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * This is quite difficult logic puzzle to be modeled and solved by CP.
 *
 * Mrs. Wheatley returned home from her job to find the household in a
 * turmoil of arguments.  Each of her five teenagers (three boys named
 * Bryan, Russell, and Stuart, and two girls named Nina and Paula) had
 * gotten angry at one of his or her siblings for a different reason
 * (finished cereal, let dog in room, used up hot water, failed to return
 * rollerblades, and hogged television) and had decided to retaliate in a
 * different way (knocked over chess game, let gerbil out of cage, hung
 * up on friend, removed light bulbs, and hid violin).
 *
 * After a few futile minutes of trying to sort out blame,
 * Mrs. Wheatley called a halt to the arguments by declaring everyone
 * equally guilty and giving each a different chore around the house
 * as that evening's punishment (cleaning the attic, basement, or garage,
 * or washing the Venetian blinds or windows).  Can you discover, for
 * each child, the sibling he or she was initially angry at, the reason
 * for the anger, the retaliatory measure he or she took, and the chore
 * meted out to each child?
 *
 * 1. No one was originally angry at the sibling who was angry at him or
 * her.
 *
 * 2. The boy who was angry at the sibling who used up all the hot water
 * taking a shower retaliated against him or her by removing all the
 * light bulbs from his or her room; the child who was angry at this boy
 * was later punished by being sent to sweep the basement.
 *
 * 3. The five siblings are: Paula, the person who was angry at Paula,
 * the person who was angry because a sibling was hogging the television,
 * the child who was told to straighten the attic, and a child to didn't
 * remove a sibling's light bulbs or hide a sibling's violin.
 *
 * 4. The child who was angry at Stuart was punished by being told to wash
 * the Venetian blinds.
 *
 * 5. Russell was punished by being sent to clean out a section of the garage.
 *
 * 6. The child who let the dog in a sibling's room didn't retaliate against another sibling by knocking over a chess game that he or she was playing.
 *
 * 7. The child who was hogging the television was angry at a sibling who wasn't punished by being told to straighten up the attic or wash the windows.
 *
 * 8. In retaliation, one person hid the violin belonging to the person who was angry at Paula.
 *
 * 9. Bryan and the person who was punished by being told to wash the
 * windows are, in same order, the child who was angry at the sibling
 * who didn't return the rollerblades and the one who retaliated against
 * a sibling by knocking over a chess game in progress.
 *
 * 10. Stuart and the person who was angry at Nina are, in some order, the child
 * who was angry at the person who finished the best cereal in the house and the one who retaliated against a sibling by hanging up on his or her best friend.
 *
 * Determine: Sibling - Angry at - Reason - Retaliation - Chore
 *
