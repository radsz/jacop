/**
 *
 * It models and solves Zebra logic puzzle.
 *
 * @author Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * It was given at The German Institute of Logical Thinking in Berlin, 1981. And 98% FAILED.
 *
 * Conditions
 *
 * 1. The Englishman lives in the red house.
 * 2. The Spaniard owns a dog.
 * 3. The Japanese is a painter.
 * 4. The Italian drinks tea.
 * 5. The Norwegian lives in the first house on the left.
 * 6. The owner of the green house drinks coffee.
 * 7. The green house is on the right of the white one.
 * 8. The sculptor breeds snails.
 * 9. The diplomat lives in the yellow house.
 * 10. Milk is drunk in the middle house.
 * 11. The Norwegian's house is next to the blue one.
 * 12. The violinist drinks fruit juice.
 * 13. The fox is in a house next to that of the doctor.
 * 14. The horse is in a house next to that of the diplomat.
 * Q. Who owns a Zebra, and who drinks water?
 *
 * They sometimes smoke different brands of cigarettes too,
 * but that's apparently no longer politically correct, so they all quit.
