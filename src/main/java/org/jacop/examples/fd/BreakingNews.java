/**
 *
 * It solves a simple logic puzzle about reporters breaking news stories.
 *
 * @author Marcin Chrapek, Miroslaw Klos, and Radoslaw Szymanek
 *
 * Logic Puzzle : Breaking News.
 *
 * The Daily Galaxy sent its four best reporters (Corey, Jimmy, Lois,
 * and Perry) to different locations (Bayonne, New Hope, Port Charles,
 * and South Amboy) to cover four breaking news events (30-pound baby,
 * blimp launching, skyscraper dedication, and beached whale). Their
 * editor is trying to remember where each of the reporters is. Can
 * you match the name of each reporter with the place he or she was
 * sent, and the event that each covered?
 *
 * 1. The 30-pound baby wasn't born in South Amboy or New Hope.
 *
 * 2. Jimmy didn't go to Port Charles.
 *
 * 3. The blimp launching and the skyscraper dedication were covered, in
 * some order, by Lois and the reporter who was sent to Port Charles.
 *
 * 4. South Amboy was not the site of either the beached whale or the
 * skyscraper dedication.
 *
 * 5. Bayonne is either the place that Corey went or the place where the
 * whale was beached, or both.
 *
 * Determine: Reporter -- Location -- Story
